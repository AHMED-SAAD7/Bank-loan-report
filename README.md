## Bank Loan Report â€“ (Power bi + SQL)
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that visualizes and analyzes bank loan data to support risk assessment, loan decision-making, and portfolio management. Built using real-world banking domain knowledge, the report showcases how financial institutions collect, process, and evaluate loan applications to manage credit risk and ensure regulatory compliance.

# Key Features
Loan Application Analysis: Insight into loan approval processes including credit checks, income verification, and risk assessment.

Credit Risk Visualization: Identifies creditworthy borrowers and highlights potential defaulters using interactive visuals.

Portfolio Health: Tracks overall loan performance, repayment trends, and underperforming segments.

Customer Segmentation: Categorizes borrowers by income level, employment status, and loan purpose.

Compliance Monitoring: Supports transparency and alignment with KYC and HMDA standards.

Fraud Detection: Highlights anomalies or patterns that might indicate fraudulent activity.

# Data Validation
To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data presented in the dashboard, a SQL query file is included. This file contains the scripts used for:

Validating raw data inputs

Verifying calculated metrics

Cross-checking data consistency across loan attributes

Using SQL for validation provides a reliable layer of data quality assurance before insights are visualized in Power BI.
